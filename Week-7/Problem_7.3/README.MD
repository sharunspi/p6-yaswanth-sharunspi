Given a linked list of N nodes.
The task is to check if the linked list has a loop.
Linkedlist can contain self loop.
Example 1:Input:N = 3value[] = {1,3,4}x = 2
Output: TrueExplanation: In above test case N = 3.
The linked list with nodes N = 3 is given.
Then value of x=2 is givenwhich means last node is connected with xth node of linked list. Therefore, there exists a loop.
Example 2:Input:N = 4value[] = {1,8,3,4}x = 0
Output: FalseExplanation: For N = 4 ,x = 0 means then last
Node->next = NULL, then the Linked list does not containsany loop.
Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
Constraints: 1 ≤ N ≤ 104 1 ≤ Data on Node ≤ 103
