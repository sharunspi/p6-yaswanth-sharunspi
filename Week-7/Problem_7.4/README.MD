Given an expression string x.
Examine whether the pairs and the orders of“{“,”}”,”(“,”)”,”[“,”]” are correct in exp.
For example, the function should return 'true' for exp= “[()]{}{()()}” and 'false' for exp = “[(])”.
Example 1:Input:{([])}
Output:trueExplanation:{ ( [ ] ) }.
Same colored brackets can form balaced pairs, with 0 number of unbalanced bracket.
Example 2:Input:()
Output:true
Explanation:().
Same bracket can form balanced pairs, and here only 1 type of bracket is present and in balancedway.
Example 3:Input:([]Output:falseExplanation:([].
Here square bracket is balanced but the small bracket is not balanced and Hence , the output will beunbalanced.
Expected Time Complexity: O(|x|)
Expected Auixilliary Space: O(|x|)
Constraints: 1 ≤ |x| ≤ 32000
