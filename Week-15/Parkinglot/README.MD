# Parking lot

### Problem

I own a parking lot that can hold up to 'n' cars at any given point in time. Each slot isgiven a number starting at 1 increasing with increasing distance from the entry point in
steps of one. I want to create an automated ticketing system that allows my customersto use my parking lot without human intervention.When a car enters my parking lot, I want to have a ticket issued to the driver. The ticketissuing process includes us documenting the registration number (number plate) andthe colour of the car and allocating an available parking slot to the car before actuallyhanding over a ticket to the driver (we assume that our customers are nice enough toalways park in the slots allocated to them). The customer should be allocated a parkingslot which is nearest to the entry. At the exit the customer returns the ticket which thenmarks the slot they were using as being available.Due to government regulation, the system should provide me with the ability to find out:●Registration numbers of all cars of a particular colour.●Slot number in which a car with a given registration number is parked.●Slot numbers of all slots where a car of a particular colour is parked.We interact with the system via a simple set of commands which produce a specificoutput. Please take a look at the example below, which includes all the commands youneed to support - they're self explanatory. The system should allow input in two ways.Just to clarify, the same codebase should support both modes of input - we don't wanttwo distinct submissions.1.It should provide us with an interactive command prompt based shell wherecommands can be typed in2.It should accept a filename as a parameter at the command prompt and read thecommands from that file

## Design system

Since the slot to be created we can make use of array data structure
We can use push to add data

1. `print` function is using to print data
2. `createParkingLot` is creating parking lot
3. `parkCar` park car will check the slot and park car
